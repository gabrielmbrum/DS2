# virtual btree :evergreen_tree:
this repo contains all code developed to implement a virtual btree :exploding_head:

## utility?
used for keep and search data in a very efficient way <br>
in this case, i use a binary file 'veÃ­culos.dat' with all infos about some vehicles and, if i did my job right, you (ðŸ«µ) will be able to search the infos of a car from its license plate :fire::fire::fire:
