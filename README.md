# virtual btree :evergreen_tree:
this repo contains all code developed to implement a virtual btree :exploding_head:

## utility?
it's a way to keep and search for data in a very efficient way (yeah this sound like boolshit, i know)<br>
in this case, i use a binary file 've√≠culos.dat' with all infos about some vehicles and, if i did my job right, you (:index_pointing_at_the_viewer:) will be able to search the infos of a car from its license plate :fire::fire::fire:
